# cProjects
This repository contains some projects that I've been working on by levels from 1(simple) to 5 (complex) after finishing studying the C language.

you'll need just to download c extensions if you're using vs code, otherwise you'll gonna need just to make a file and put the rpojects in and run it if you're using codeblock or any similar type of coding consoles.
